# What is Transfer Learning?
In the classic supervised learning scenario of machine learning, if we intend to train a model for some task and domain 
A
, we assume that we are provided with labeled data for the same task and domain. We can see this clearly in Figure 1, where the task and domain of the training and test data of our model 
A
 is the same. We will later define in more detail what exactly a task and a domain are). For the moment, let us assume that a task is the objective our model aims to perform, e.g. recognize objects in images, and a domain is where our data is coming from, e.g. images taken in San Francisco coffee shops.
